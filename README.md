# iPhoneX Sentimental Analysis
A sentimental Analysis to determine the people's opinion and attitude towards the new iPhone X

## Sentiment Analysis on reviews from Kaggle
### “Obviously anything that accessorizes or enhances the iPhone is always pretty cool.” Said Harry Shum, Jr.

##### In this study, I have used dataset from Kaggle on iPhone X reviews. The dataset contains the reviews from different users when Apple, Inc. announced the new iPhone X. 
 (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/kewalkishang/iphonexreview). In order to analyze the sentiment of the reviewers, I am using in-built packages from python library. The data contains review comment, date and the user name. To understand the word distribution among the review comments, I have generated the word cloud using the stopwords.


The values showed that there are 1191 positive and 594 negative comments in the dataset. Then to add some value, we are going to closely visualize the negative reviews on this new iPhone X using word cloud. The end results were interesting, and the few insights were able determined through these words.
